- To change user password
passwd root

- Adding a non-root user
adduser noroot

When creating a virtual machine, select a fixed disk size instead of one that is dynamically allocated. It is faster to add files to a fixed disk, and there is less
file fragmentation

The preload application (apt-get install preload) identifies a user's most commonly used programs and preloads binaries and dependencies into memory to provide faster access. It works automatically after the first restart following installation. 
Install Boot Up Manager (BUM) to disable unnecessary services and applications that are enabled during the boot up (apt-get install bum),

Add gnome-do (apt-get install gnome-do) to launch applications directly from the keyboard. To configure gnome-do, select it from the Applications | Accessories menu. Once launched, select the Preferences menu, activate the Quiet Launch function, and select a launch command (for example, Ctrl + Shift). Clear any existing commands, and then enter the command line to be executed when the launch keys are selected. Rather than launching directly from the keyboard, it is possible to write specific scripts that launch complex operations.

- Run Applications as noroot
apt-get install sux

ps aux |grep iceweasel

Enter the command line: ps aux |grep iceweasel. As you can see,Iceweasel is running with root privileges.
Close Iceweasel, and relaunch using the command sux - noroot iceweasel

Disabling IPv6 can be accomplished by
editing the /etc/sysctl.conf file to include the following lines:
#disable ipv6
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable = 1


SCTP is an increasingly common protocol on networks, but it is rarely tested on corporate networks.

xprobe2 for OS detection

Marc Ruef's vulscan (http://www.computec.ch/mruef/
software/nmap_nse_vulscan-1.0.tar.gz), which combines the fingerprinting
feature of nmap (using the Â–sV flag) with lookups against major vulnerabilities, such
as MITRE, OSVDB, and SecurityFocus.

To invoke one of the scripts from the command line, use the --script flag, and
then identify the script name. One script that is frequently used is nmap's general
vulnerability scanner, launched using the following command:
root@kali:~# nmap -sV --script=vulscan.nse digitaldefence.ca


A must-have script is the SpiderLabs script to screenshot web services.
It requires the wkhtmltoimage tool to be downloaded (http://
wkhtmltopdf.googlecode.com) and placed in the /usr/local/
bin folder. The screenshot script itself should then be downloaded
(https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Nmap-Tools/blob/
master/NSE/http-screenshot.nse) and placed in /usr/local/
share/nmap/scripts. When invoked, this script produces a visual
record of all the identified web services, making it easier to select a
target for testing later.
